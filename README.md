# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Identified distinct customer groups based on spending behavior to support targeted marketing strategies.

# 🚀 Project Overview
Performed customer segmentation for a mall dataset using unsupervised learning.

Used K-Means clustering to group customers based on:

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score

# 🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

# 🧪 Key Steps
Loaded and explored mall customer data.

Visualized distributions for income, age, and spending score.

Scaled features for effective clustering.

Determined optimal number of clusters using:

Elbow Method to find optimal cluster (k) 

Silhouette Score

Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers.

Visualized clusters using 2D and 3D plots.

# 📊 Key Findings
Discovered distinct clusters like:

High income, low spending (savers)

Low income, high spending (potentially risky)

High income, high spending (ideal targets)

Average income, moderate spending (safe bets)

Helped identify targetable groups for personalized marketing.

# 🎯 Business Impact
